# Question: Is it possible to predict the price of Majorca's Airbnb rentals?

Airbnb is a home-sharing platform that allows home-owners and renters ('hosts') to put their properties ('listings') online, so that guests can pay to stay in them. Hosts are expected to set their own prices for their listings. Although Airbnb and other sites provide some general guidance, there are currently no free services which help hosts price their properties. Paid third party pricing software is available, but generally you are required to put in your own expected average price ('base price'), and the algorithm will vary the daily price around that base price on each day depending on day of the week, seasonality, how far away the date is, and other factors [1].

This project aims to use machine learning (ML) techniques in order to **predict the price for properties (referred to as listings) in Majorca**. The ML approach that will be taken to predict the price is by applying regression models to the given data.
